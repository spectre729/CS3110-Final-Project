This is my CS 3110 Final Project code for the Spring 2024 semester. 

I worked with the following two people on this final project(netID omitted for privacy reasons):

Anand Bannerji

Jonathan Miller


For CS 3110 students/future CS 3110 students/any student taking a functional programming class who stumbled upon this repository:
I took this class during the Spring 2024 Semester with Michael Clarkson. Here was his policy on academic integrity regarding final projects:

"Many 3110 final projects have been made public in GitHub over the last few years. Obviously, you may not copy off of your predecessors. But from time to time you might stumble across their work as you try to learn how to use some library. It is okay with me if there are a few lines of code they invented and you reuse, but only under the following conditions: 1. You must cite them. 2. If they include a license file in their repo, you must meet the terms of that license."

Current CS 3110 Professors may have a similar or different policy. Please respect their policy and use my code only as a reference/inspiration. Thank you.
