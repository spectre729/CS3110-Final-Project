The following libraries were used in the project:
batteries, bisect_ppx, ppx_inline_test, ounit2, and spectrum

Most likely you are only missing spectrum since we have used the rest in class. If you are missing any of the libraries then:

First make sure that your opam is up to date by running

opam update
opam upgrade

Then install the libraries by running

opam install <libaries>

With <libraries> replaced with the name of the libraries you are missing. Ex:

opam install spectrum
opam install batteries bisect_ppx ppx_inline_test ounit2 spectrum


You can build the program by running:

dune build

And you can run the program by running:

dune exec bin/main.exe

Running the following command will reset all three leaderboards to their default:

dune exec bin/main.exe R
